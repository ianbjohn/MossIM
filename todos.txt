-Make sure a client can actually connect to a server on a different machine, ask them to enter a port. (Works with different IPs on a private 192.168.x.x network. Has not yet tested with the global internet.)
-Make sure the server binds correctly. Do some more research into what happens when binding to INADDR_ANY.

-Add roles, such as user, moderator, administrator.
	-Administrators can !promote users to mods, !demote mods to users, !ban or !kick users, and !unban an IP
	-Moderators can !ban and !kick users, and !unban an IP
-Have a list of banned users in a text file or something, use for respective banning / unbanning etc.
-Make packets' payloads encrypted with a basic encryption scheme.
-Add a !rename command for changing one's nickname

-Improve the Interface with the client, try and make it so that if the window gets resized, the chat window's get re-drawn correctly
	(Seems to be an issue when testing on a Ubuntu VM. Window gets drawn incorrectly, and messages get drawn twice. Test on other machines to try and track this down better. It could be an issue with a newer version of ncurses, and I might have to update the client code.)
-Increase the size of available messages, and let the user scroll through older messages. Maybe save much older messages to a .txt file for a certain amount of time. 
-Fix warnings that Ubuntu's GCC pics up. Or supress them since they don't seem to matter.
